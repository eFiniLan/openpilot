# Disable Dcam Upload
Disables uploading the dcam file to comma connect. Useful for if you want to
record dcam footage but do not want it to be used on comma connect.

_note: It does not appear comma auto-uploads dcam footage at this time, so you
can mostly achieve the same affect by simply not requesting uploads of your dcam
footage on comma connect._
