# Importer
A utility class for dynamically importing modules. Imports all modules from the selfdrive folder whose filename begin with _c_. This allows for a single import in openpilot files to import all community modules. Using a single import reduces merge conflicts.

This doesn't add any features to openpilot itself and is intended to be used when building other patches.
