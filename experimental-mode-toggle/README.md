Allows toggling experimental mode on and off from the gap adjust button on the steering wheel.

## Cars Supported
Currently only supports hkg vehicles but more will likely be added.

## Status
Alpha

Simple change but expecting to change the interface soon. The current behavior
toggles experimental mode with a short press of the button, but I plan on
changing it to use a long press instead. There is also limited car support.
