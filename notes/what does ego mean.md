# What does ego mean in openpilot?
Ego in openpilot refers to the concept of ego-motion. A common use of the term ego-motion is to describe the motion of a camera in relation to a fixed environment. This particular description is often used in computer vision applications.

One definition of the word ego would be the sense of self. Using this definition of ego we can see how the word could be applied to motion. Ego-motion would then mean the sense of ones own motion. So in the context of openpilot \*\_ego would refer to the motion that openpilot thinks it currently is undergoing.
