# Distance Based Curvature
Changes the get\_lag\_adjusted\_curvature function to use the distance from the
longitudinal mpc instead of calculating distance from the current velocity.

**NOTE: I believe that this approach isn't mathematically correct, however it
does happen to give good results in some cases depending on the current driving
model and the car.**

## Status
?

It probably isn't correct but it also is stable so ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯
