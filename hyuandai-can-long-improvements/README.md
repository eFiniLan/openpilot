# HKG-can Longitudinal Control Improvements
Improvements to how openpilot sends longitudinal commands to allow for smoother
acceleration and deceleration while still maintaining responsiveness.

# Status
Experimental

Have been daily driving this for a while now. However, due to the nature of the
change it needs to be thoroughly tested on more cars before I'm willing to call
it more than experimental.

# Upstream
Planning on trying to get this pushed upstream to openpilot once I feel there
has been enough testing and that it's been tuned well.

# Detailed Explanation of Change
Coming soon...
