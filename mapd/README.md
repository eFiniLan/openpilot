# mapd

A process for getting map data from osm. A port of the move-fast mapd
implementation into the go programming language for better performance.


This patch does not include the full program. The full program is written in the
go programming language and this patch automatically downloads and runs the
program as a binary. To view the program source code go to the
[mapd repository](https://github.com/pfeiferj/openpilot-mapd).
